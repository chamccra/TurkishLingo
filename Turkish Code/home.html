    <h2>WHY LEARN TURKISH?</h2>
    <p> Turkish is one of the world's most spoken languages with 75 million
      people who speak Turkish as a first language and another 15 million 
     people who speak Turkish as a second language.</p>
     
     <p>The Republic of Turkey is strategically connected, geographically and
     culturally, to Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East. And so, 
     Turkish is advantageous to anyone interested in the international business
     or politics of those regions. Likewise, for students pursuing careers in
     business or government service, opportunities will only continue to 
     increase as Turkey continues to develop as a global  economic power.</p>
